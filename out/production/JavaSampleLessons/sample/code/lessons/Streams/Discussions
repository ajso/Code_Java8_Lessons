===================Java Stream==============================

Streams bring functional programming to java.
Advantages of streams.
    -very efficient
    -use lambda
    -parallelstreams make it very easy for multthread operations

Stream Source.
    -Stream can be created from collections, arrays, list, sets, ints, longs, double e.t.c
Stream Operations can be either intermediate or terminal.
    -intermediate such as filter, maps or sort return stream so we can chain multiple operations.
        -Zero or more intermediate operation are allowed.
        -order matter for large datasets. i.e filter first and then sort.
        -use parallelStream for large datasets.
    -terminal operations such as forEach,collect or reduce are either void or return a non-stream result(they receive a stream).
        -One terminal operation in allowed.
        -forEach applies the same function for each element.
        -collect saves elements into a collection.
